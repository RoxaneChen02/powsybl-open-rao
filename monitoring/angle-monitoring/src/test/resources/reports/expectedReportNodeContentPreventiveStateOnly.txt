         Angle Cnec acPrev is constrained in preventive state, it cannot be secured.
         Applying the following remedial action(s) in order to reduce constraints on CNEC "acPrev": []
         + Some Angle Cnecs are not secure:
            Angle Cnec acPrev (with importing network element VL1 and exporting network element VL2) at state preventive has an angle of -4°.
