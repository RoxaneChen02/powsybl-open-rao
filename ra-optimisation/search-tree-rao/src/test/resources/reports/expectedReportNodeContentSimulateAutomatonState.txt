   + Optimizing automaton state contingency1 - auto.
      Initial situation:
      Topological automaton state contingency1 - auto has been skipped as no topological automatons were activated.
      Automaton state contingency1 - auto has been optimized.
      Scenario "contingency1": initial cost = null (functional: null, virtual: null, detail: null), no remedial actions activated, cost after auto optimization = -381.05 (functional: -381.05, virtual: 0.00, detail: null)
